# Systems-programming-Assignment-one
Assignment 1 in the system programming course, an assignment in the JAVA language that includes files and threads

## Description

In the first part of the assignment we had to write a code that helps to organize teams according to ranking in the soccer world championship.
A file called teams.txt contains a team name and its ranking determined by past results.
The program created a file called rank.txt that ranks the groups.

#### Example:

```teams.txt:```

![teams](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74205488/202432959-f03b1acb-2eff-4f57-83a8-970a816848a7.jpg)


```rank.txt:```

![rank](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74205488/202432956-a899b3aa-1267-4d82-b8a3-88c5d923ce4c.jpg)




In the second part we did a simulation for the "The Big Pumpkin" competition.
The goal of the competition is to grow the highest pumpkin.
The user enters a maximum height, the pumpkins grow randomly. The first pumpkin to reach the maximum height wins, the second pumpkin to reach the maximum height will be in second place and so on.

#### Example:

![pumpkin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74205488/202432950-4b8d0f37-c842-4fd0-b7ee-263d27b5eba2.jpg)
